  <h1> Paragraph </h1> 
  <p>This is a short paragraph written to demonstrate the proper way to use HTML. 
I have already wrapped my paragraph with tags to classify it as such. 
<i>To demonstrate my learning, I will use tags to italicize this text.</i> 
<b>Furthermore, now I will bold this part of my text.</b> </p>

  <h2> Image of a bird </h2>
  <img src="Bird.jpg" width="400" height="300">

  <h3> A button with an onClick event to prompt the user! </h3>
  <button type="button" onclick="prompt('Whats your favorite bird?')">Click Me!</button>
